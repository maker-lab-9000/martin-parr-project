"""Image file I/O, and the one place colour management happens.

Every pixel that enters this project comes through ``load_rgb``, which does
two things no other module should have to remember:

**EXIF orientation.** A camera that was held sideways records the rotation
as a tag rather than rotating the pixels. The trainer crops a fixed 6% from
each edge, so an unoriented image gets the wrong edges cropped, and a
portrait frame would be sampled as landscape. ``ImageOps.exif_transpose``
resolves the tag into real pixel order.

**ICC profiles.** The whole project is a colour measurement, so treating an
Adobe RGB or ProPhoto scan as if it were sRGB would bake a systematic error
into the learned look - the more so because the target corpus is archival
scans whose colour management is part of what we are matching. When a
profile is embedded, the image is converted to sRGB with ``ImageCms``. When
none is present, sRGB is assumed, which is the web convention and correct
for Commons JPEGs. When one is present but unreadable, sRGB is assumed and
the failure is recorded rather than swallowed, so the report can count it.

``ImageMeta`` travels with the pixels so the trainer can publish profile
statistics: a corpus that is secretly half Adobe RGB should be visible, not
silently averaged in.
