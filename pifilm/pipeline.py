"""The Parr pipeline: normalise, apply the LUT, add grain.

The order is fixed and matters. The LUT was fitted on normalised input, so
normalisation comes first; grain is a property of the developed film, so it
goes on last. The same ``Pipeline`` serves full-resolution captures, the
low-resolution live preview (``grain=False``) and batch reprocessing, which
is what guarantees the preview shows the grade the capture will get.

``info`` returns the gains that were applied, whether either gain hit its
clamp, and the LUT's content hash. The capture app writes all of it to its
log so a surprising frame can be explained after the fact.
