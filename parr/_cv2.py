"""One place that imports OpenCV, so one place explains how to install it.

OpenCV is deliberately not a base dependency. On Raspberry Pi OS it comes
from apt (`python3-opencv`), which is built with GTK so the preview window
works; pip's `opencv-python-headless` wheel silently has no GUI. Everywhere
else it arrives through the `[opencv]` extra, which `[train]` and `[dev]`
both include.

A bare `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cv2'` does not tell a user
which of those two paths they are missing, so this guard does.
